# p5.js Projects
This is a repo that summarizes my p5.js projects. <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> is a `JavaScript` library for creative coding and interactive graphics.<br>

For each project, I have attached the corresponding GitHub repo and also the link to the GitHub page where you can play the game.

 **Pong** <br>
------------------

Then I implemented the Pong game.<br>
Repo/code: https://github.com/DavidDZ7/pong <br>
Play here: https://daviddz7.github.io/pong/

Use `W` and `S` for the left player, and `UP` and `DOWN` for the right player.<br>
You can adjust the window size, the ball's speed increases with the window width.

After Pong, I decided to code the Breakout game.<br>
